# cardano-config

This is a set of [configuration files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/understanding-config-files.md) used to set up Cardano Node.

Configuration files are present for both `mainnet` and `testnet`.

They have been prepared basing on [The Cardano Operations book](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html).

See [releases](https://github.com/byron-network/cardano-config/releases) for more specific setup.
